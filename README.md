# Java Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal Java learning repository!  
Here you'll find everything from beginner coding challenges to my first Java-based 2D game project. I'm learning step by step — documenting the process and building real projects along the way.

## 🧠 LeetCode & Coding Practice

Inside the [`leetcode/`](./leetcode) folder you'll find my solutions to problems I'm using to learn Java logic and syntax.

- `twoSum.java` – My first LeetCode problem (difficulty: easy)
- `duplicates.java` – My second LeetCode problem (difficulty: easy)
- `largestNumber.java` – A challenge I found and solved via ChatGPT
- `CeaserCipher.java` - AP Computer Science A frq problem that I solved

## 📒 Notes

In the [`notes/`](./notes) folder, I jot down things I'm learning. These aren't full programs, just helpful references to understand topics like:

- Arrays
- Loops
- Operators
- Basic Java syntax

## 🧮 Projects

In the [`projects/`](./projects) folder, I take on small and big Java projects to improve my skills:

### `calculator/`  
My first ever Java project. A basic calculator that interacts with the user through the terminal. Great intro to conditionals, input/output, and data types.

### `mario2D/`  
🚧 *Currently in progress!*  (Check out my other respository for this project)
A 2D Mario-inspired game using Java + LWJGL. This is where I'm learning the basics of game development including:

- Creating a game window
- Drawing with OpenGL
- Handling game loops & inputs
- Structuring a bigger Java project

---

## 💻 Tech I'm Learning

- Java 17+
- LeetCode problem solving
- LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library)
- Gradle build system
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a playable 2D platformer game
- Understand object-oriented programming in Java
- Get internship-ready with real-world coding experience
- Create a portfolio that shows what I'm learning
